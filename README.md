## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Assuming [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) is installed, run the following commands to install the project:

**With git clone**:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/boneal2020/pfc2020-v4.git your-project-name # Clone the project

cd pfc2020-v4

yarn install # or npm install
gatsby develop # or yarn run develop
```

Note: Yarn is preferred method.

Using the preferred command `yarn run develop` (or you can use the standard `gatsby develop`), you will see the following URLs:

```
http://localhost:8000
http://localhost:8000/___graphql
http://localhost:8000/admin
```

â”œâ”€â”€ gatsby-node.js
â”œâ”€â”€ gatsby-ssr.js
â”œâ”€â”€ wrapPageElement.js

```


1. **config**:
   All language settings: languages, strings, menu...
   In `i18n.js` you can set the languages and some others important info

2. **src**:
   Components, hooks, templates and fixed pages (Different of markdown pages, these pages have the same url for all languages and the text content needs to be inserted in `config/translations` files).

3. **static**:
   Netlify settings and images.

4. **gatsby-browser.js**:
   External files and the layout wrapper setting.

5. **gatsby-config.js**:
   Gatsby plugins.

6. **gatsby-node.js**:
   Logic for generating pages and posts by manipulating GraphQL.

7. **wrapPageElement.js**
   As this component wraps every page (due to the wrapPageElement API) we can be sure to have the locale available everywhere!

## About Netlify CMS
You must change the Netlify data "repo" and "site_domain" according your Github repository in `static/admin/config.yml`.

```
backend:
    name: github # Local
    # name: git-gateway # Prod
    repo: _owner-name/repo-name_ # Path to your GitHub repository
    branch: master
    site_domain: _site-url_ # If site extists
```

Realize that you need to use `name: github` for local development and `name: git-gateway` for prod environment (netlify)

## Important notes:

-   General information for languages are defined in `config/i18n.js`.
-   The general content translations are located in `config/translations` and the `useTranslations` custom hook pulls these translations (via GraphQL query) and inserts them into the pages.
-   The menu items translations are located in `config/menu` and the `useMenu` custom hook pulls these translations (via GraphQL query) and inserts them into the pages.
-   **âœ¨ New**: Adding corresponding urls are locating in `config/language-mapping` and the `useLanguageMapping` custom hook pulls these translations (via GraphQL query) and inserts them into the pages. It is used together with the language switcher so that the page is directed to a page corresponding to the other language.
-   Due to the use of a global layout / context API and the language code passed to all pages (see `gatsby-node.js`), you know on all pages which language is currently displayed.
-   A custom component for the <a> tag is implemented - this way links can stay the same for every language, without the need to manually write path prefixes.
